Ensuring descentalization by informing people on how to delegate and why proper delegation matters. I want to help with policies that ensure the health of the ecosystem for many years to come.

I can report however is needed by this circle. I can provide multiple reports if needed as well.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###

I have 6 years experience working as a public servant in the administration and operations departments. I know what looks effective on paper but, could have hang ups down the road. Bureaucracy needs to be understood from the lowest level to the highest level to work well.
