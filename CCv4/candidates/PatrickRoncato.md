### Describe Your Role in the Community ###

I took part as PA/ vPA in Funds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

### What key ideas or issues would you like to champion as a representative at the Catalyst Circle? ###

I would like to give mediatic exposure to Catalyst outside the crypto community, contacting some journalists and finding spots for some articles/interviews. 
Regarding issues, I would like to introduce a newsletter to voters who can follow their favorite projects updates.

### How do you intend to measure your engagement. Here some examples and suggestions for effective reporting ###

I am happy to follow the template that you linked on the question above.

### Is there anything else you would like voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle? ###
