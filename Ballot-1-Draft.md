### 1. Shall the new DripDropz staking program deploy a first-year annual rewards curve targeting a maximum APY of 6%, 8% or 10%?

> In order to encourage holding of the DRIP token, DripDropz will activate a staking program to reward DripDropz users for holding the Cardano native asset. Selecting from the following max APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) will determine the amount of staking rewards, and the amount of time that the reward program will run.

```
A. Target 6% max APY.
B. Target 8% max APY.
C. Target 10% max APY.
```

### 2. What shall DripDropz set the DRIP redemption amount for users to upgrade to the new DripDropz Pro utility feature?

> The DripDropz Pro feature will include multi-drip features (Drip to multiple wallets) and staking features. With additional features planned. Selecting from the following options will determine the amount of DRIP token that will be required to upgrade to the DripDropz Pro feature. The ADA, minus transaction fees, will be returned upon successful registration.

```
A. Redeem with 2 ADA + 5,000 DRIP.
B. Redeem with 2 ADA + 7,500 DRIP.
C. Redeem with 2 ADA + 10,000 DRIP.
```

### 3. Shall DripDropz set the review process for curved decay at once per quarter, once per six month, or once per year?

> In order to maintain the distribution levels of the DripDropz DRIP token, the default amount of DRIP received per wallet must occasionally be reduced. Choosing a timeframe below will determine the maximum time that DripDropz will wait to examine the date and amounts of reward decay. Provisions will be made to limit the amount small wallets receive when claiming the DRIP token.

```
A. Review every quarter.
B. Review every six months.
C. Review once annually.
D. Leave unchanged.
```

### 4. Shall DripDropz accept an allocation from the treasury of DRIP tokens to enable Node Operator rewards and build a more decentralized DripDropz platform?

> DripDropz formed with a 100% allocation of forty five billion (45,000,000,000) DRIP tokens to the users of the platform. In order to provide more decentralization for the platform, some of the DRIP not yet in circulation can be allocated for that purpose. This request is for 3%, 2%, or 1% of the total supply of DRIP tokens to be set aside for Node Operator rewards.

```
A. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 3% of the total supply.
B. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 2% of the total supply.
C. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 1% of the total supply.
D. No, do not allow DripDropz to allocate any of the total supply.
```

### 5. Shall DripDropz accept an allocation from the treasury of DRIP tokens to enable operational flexibility, DEX/CEX platform incentives, community incentives and DripDropz team and employee rewards?

> DripDropz formed with a 100% allocation of forty five billion (45,000,000,000) DRIP tokens to the users of the platform. In order to provide flexibility, community incentives, and rewards to the founding team and employees, some of the DRIP not yet in circulation can be allocated to that purpose. This request is for 5%, 7.5%, or 10% of total supply of DRIP tokens to be set aside for operations, community incentives, and vesting to the founding team members and employees over a 4 year schedule.

```
A. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 10% of the total supply.
B. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 7.5% of the total supply.
C. Yes, permit DripDropz to allocate 5% of the total supply.
D. No, do not allow DripDropz to allocate any of the total supply.

@headelf that's a lot if you just are trying to get your family members or kids familiar with cardano. Dripdropz and staking in a pool is a good on-ramp to Cardano.


[15-Apr-22 11:27 AM] RedDestruction#5297
dripdropz is something to get someone into the environment and get them excited that they are receiving some tokens that they are interested in for participating


[15-Apr-22 11:33 AM] RedDestruction#5297
staking is helpful but don't think it provides the gratification that dripdropz does and the freedom of choice in tokens

In regards to 1), we can already provide liquidity on a variety of DEXes to gain a reasonable amount of APY. The main focus and incentive for people to stake DRIP shouldnt be just for an APY gain. Instead the amount staked by a wallet should give that wallet a ‚Äúlevel‚Äù ie gold,premium,diamond,etc. In my opinion this is what should be needed to access DripDropz Pro or other planned features. Additionally, I know this is not the voting stage yet, just stating my point: The minimum ADA should not be changed as since day one wallet splitting was encouraged to a degree. And with 44.5 billion tokens left to go, we have a long way ahead before we should be vary of depleting token resources.

An average user like me might not understand enough about Node Operation to answer question 5 in a meaningful way. I'd at least want a brief summary of how node operators are currently incentivized. Given that the other questions are relatively easy to answer, and more immediately clear how they impact the average user, people may decide to vote anyway, and give question 5 their best guess. Perhaps consider a 'Not Sure' option so that the vote is not muddied.
(This is obviously assuming that all 6 questions are presented as a set, as I'm understanding from the document that was shared. If you can just choose to vote for one but not another, then it's not a problem)
Also, I'm not sure what operational flexibility implies in question 6.

@Lloyd Duhon it does look like you ask for the votes aswell in your first message "and the vote choices".

[16-Apr-22 01:50 PM] astrolape#8562
Providing liquidity on a dex and staking on the native platform of a token are really different and not interchangeable. Because of impermanent loss, the danger of exploits, and an APY that is often tied to a different token (in case of yield farming), I much rather prefer to have a lower APY via staking then providing liquidity on a dex.
If staking is combined with a lock-up period, it also serves to stabilize the price of a token, and can be used as an indicator to see how many people are "going long" on a project.
Last but not least, staking can be used to redistribute part of the fees earned by the protocol to the token holders, which is one of the stated goals of dripdropz.

I actually chose 8% instead of 10% rewards, but I'm really glad dripdropz is making use of staking, and hope this will stay a central feature of dripdropz.


[16-Apr-22 02:07 PM] Borgia#0064
You are right and I agree with you on choosing staking over LP, however the same people that choose to LP their ADA instead of staking it would choose the same with their DRIP. What I was stating is to give a reason for people to stake their tokens other than just the APY they would gain. Fee distributions like you suggested or access to the platform‚Äôs other features according to the amount staked. But for the lock-up, I dont think the team is focused on the token price (they might be legally obliged to) but rather giving functionality to the DRIP token and the platform.


[17-Apr-22 03:32 AM] manolo.yha#5118
it will be good for the community so that there is more participation in the project... for the first voting session the points are not bad.

Exactly my view. Could perhaps the DripDropz team write a medium article where they describe the current situation, motivation for change and implication the changes will bring? E.g. I understood that the team did not get any rewards for putting the platform together (at least no Drips). So how they fund themselves now? How big chunk is 10% of tokens compared with other platforms? How much work is operating nodes? Is there a similar function at other platforms? How they pay them? Especially it would be great to hear more from the founders about the token decay reviewing background. The slashing will  depend on actual withdrawal volumes? You have some defined curve of token emissions already and you would just check against it? Why it would not be done continuously?
